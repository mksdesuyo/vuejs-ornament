        Greetings! I'm Rizqi Muhammad Khatami Sandi, a
        <span class="font-bold">Junior Web Developer</span> certified by BNSP and based in Garut,
        Indonesia.<br />
        With a proper foundation in web development, I specialize in creating

        Beyond coding, I have deep passion for learning new languages and cultures. I can
        communicate in <span class="font-bold">English</span> and
        <span class="font-bold">Japanese</span> at professional and conversational levels, along
        with some understanding of <span class="font-bold">Arabic</span>. <br />
        My enthusiasm for personal growth extends to physical activities as wellâ€”I enjoy
        <span class="font-bold">weightlifting and calisthenics</span>,
        <span class="font-bold">cycling</span>, and <span class="font-bold">swimming</span>, which
        help me stay positive.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, I've earned notable certifications including
        <span class="font-bold">Google IT Support (Coursera)</span> and

        >, showcasing my versatility to continous learning.
        <br />
        <br />
